<h1>Cloud Computing Overview</h1>
        
<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users can access and use computing resources on-demand from cloud service providers.</p>
        
<h2>Key Aspects of Cloud Computing</h2>
<ul>
    <li>On-demand self-service: Users can provision resources as needed without human interaction from the service provider.</li>
    <li>Broad network access: Services are available over the network and accessible through standard mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Resource pooling: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.</li>
    <li>Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand.</li>
    <li>Measured service: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported for transparency.</li>
</ul>
