<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Cloud computing models define the way cloud services are deployed and delivered to users. Here are the main cloud computing models:</p>

<div class="model-container">
    <div class="model">
        <h2>1. Service Models</h2>
        <p>These models describe the type of service offered by cloud providers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Offers a platform for developers to build, run, and manage applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Function as a Service (FaaS):</strong> Allows execution of individual functions in the cloud.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="model">
        <h2>2. Deployment Models</h2>
        <p>These models define how cloud services are made available to users:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Services are provided by third-party providers and available to anyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> Cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a single organization.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Cloud:</strong> Infrastructure is shared by several organizations with common concerns.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="model">
        <h2>3. Architecture Models</h2>
        <p>These models describe the structure and components of cloud systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microservices:</strong> Applications are built as a collection of small, independent services.</li>
            <li><strong>Serverless:</strong> Allows building and running applications without managing servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Containers:</strong> Packages application code with dependencies for easy deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):</strong> Organizes software components to provide services to other components.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<br />

<h2>Choosing the Right Model</h2>
<p>The choice of cloud computing model depends on various factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Business requirements and goals</li>
    <li>Security and compliance needs</li>
    <li>Scalability and flexibility requirements</li>
    <li>Budget constraints</li>
    <li>Existing IT infrastructure and expertise</li>
</ul>

<p>Organizations often use a combination of these models to create a cloud strategy that best suits their needs. As cloud technology evolves, new models and variations continue to emerge, offering more specialized and optimized solutions for different use cases.</p>
